# ðŸ•¹ AI-Enhanced VR Pac-Man Experience

A VR reimagining of the classic Pac-Man game, built in **Unity** with **C# scripting**, **AI-powered ghost behavior**, and immersive **Virtual Reality controls**. This project demonstrates the integration of **game design**, **AI programming**, and **VR optimization techniques** to deliver a polished, professional-grade experience.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  

This projectâ€™s primary goal was to combine **classic arcade nostalgia** with **modern VR technology** and **AI-driven gameplay**. We set out to create an **immersive, dynamic environment** where player actions directly influence enemy AI states.  

The result is a **two-level VR Pac-Man** where the ghosts are powered by **state machine AI**, the environment is built for **360Â° interaction**, and VR-specific optimizations ensure comfort and responsiveness.

## ðŸ§  AI Implementation  

The **Ghost AI** is implemented using the **State Design Pattern**, making it modular, scalable, and easy to modify.  

Ghost states include:  
- **Chase State** â€“ Ghost actively pursues the player using adaptive pathfinding.  
- **Scatter State** â€“ Ghosts retreat to maze corners, creating strategic breathing space for the player.  
- **Frightened State** â€“ Triggered by player power-ups; ghosts avoid the player.  
- **Idle State** â€“ Ghosts remain passive until triggered by gameplay events.  

AI decisions are based on **real-time player position tracking**, **event triggers**, and **timed transitions**.
